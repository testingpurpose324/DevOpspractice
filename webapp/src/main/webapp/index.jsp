<h1>Though of the day</h1>
<h2>No one is perfect - that’s why pencils have erasers.</h2>
<h2>You always pass failure on the way to success.</h2>
<h2>You’re off to great places, today is your day. Your mountain is waiting, so get on your way.</h2>
<h2>Winning doesn’t always mean being first. Winning means you’re doing better than you’ve done before.</h2>
<h2>A truly happy person is one who can enjoy the scenery while on a detour</h2>
