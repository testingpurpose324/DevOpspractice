<h1>Though of the day</h1>
<h2>No one is perfect - that why pencils have erasers.</h2>
<h2>You always pass failure on the way to success.</h2>
<h2>You are off to great places, today is your day. Your mountain is waiting, so get on your way.</h2>
<h2>Winning does not always mean being first. Winning means you are doing better than you have done before.</h2>
<h2>A truly happy person is one who can enjoy the scenery while on a detour</h2>
